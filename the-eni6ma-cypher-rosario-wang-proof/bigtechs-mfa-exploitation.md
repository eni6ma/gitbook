# BigTech's MFA Exploitation

## The Strategy Behind Big Tech's Push for MFA: Dependency and Exploitation

The push by big tech companies to mandate the use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for regular consumer authentication and credentials reflects a strategy that extends beyond mere security enhancements. This practice can be seen as a method to entrench users within the technological ecosystems of these companies. By examining this strategy, it becomes evident that the mandatory use of MFA serves to reinforce consumer reliance on big tech devices and membership within their ecosystems, ultimately leading to an oppressive dynamic.&#x20;

The implementation of MFA has become a standard practice for enhancing the security of online accounts. However, the requirement for users to possess specific hardware devices, such as smartphones or dedicated tokens, provides substantial benefits to large tech companies. These benefits include increased hardware sales, enhanced data collection, strengthened market positions, and greater regulatory influence. While hardware-dependent MFA enhances security, it also raises ethical and equity concerns that must be addressed to ensure that digital security practices are fair and inclusive for all users.&#x20;

The Rosario-Wang Cypher presents an alternative by offering robust, device-independent security solutions that mitigate these issues, promoting a more accessible and equitable approach to cybersecurity. This strategy explores the fundamental advantages these companies gain by binding access to user accounts with the necessity of owning hardware devices, examining the economic, strategic, and systemic implications of this practice.&#x20;

By binding security to the ownership of specific hardware devices, big tech companies reinforce consumer reliance on their ecosystems, monetize digital security, and normalize surveillance. This practice not only undermines individual autonomy and exacerbates digital inequality but also creates a system where user data is continuously harvested and exploited. Understanding this strategy highlights the need for alternative, device-independent security solutions that promote fairness, autonomy, and privacy, such as those offered by the Rosario-Wang Cypher.

### **Implications of BigTech MFA Proliferation**

1. **Increased Dependency on Big Tech**
   * **Reliance on Specific Brands**: The requirement for specific hardware for MFA creates a dependency on the big tech companies that manufacture these devices. Users become reliant on these companies for not only their device needs but also for the security of their online accounts.
   * **Digital Divide**: This practice exacerbates the digital divide, as individuals who cannot afford the required hardware are effectively excluded from secure online access. This exclusion disproportionately affects lower-income users, reinforcing economic disparities.
2. **Control Over Digital Security Standards**
   * **Standardization of Security Protocols**: By embedding MFA requirements that depend on their hardware, tech companies can influence and set industry standards for digital security. This control allows them to shape the future of cybersecurity practices to their advantage.
   * **Regulatory Influence**: Large tech companies with significant market influence can lobby for regulations that favor their security solutions, further entrenching their position in the market. This influence over regulatory bodies can shape the legal landscape to support their business models.

### **Control and Dependency : Economic Exploitation**

Big tech companies leverage MFA as a mechanism to bind users to their devices and services. By requiring MFA, which often necessitates the use of specific hardware such as smartphones or tokens, tech companies ensure that users must engage with their products continually. This dependency creates a captive user base, where the consumer's ability to access essential services is tied to their continued use of the company's hardware and ecosystem.

MFA involves constant verification and data collection, allowing tech companies to monitor and influence user behavior subtly. This continuous need for authentication not only enforces compliance with the company's security protocols but also normalizes the dependence on their ecosystem, embedding the company deeper into the user's daily life.

1. **Increased Hardware Sales**
   * **Revenue Generation**: By requiring users to authenticate via specific hardware devices, large tech companies indirectly boost the sales of these devices. For instance, companies that manufacture smartphones and tablets see a direct increase in their sales figures as users must possess these devices to secure their accounts.
   * **Market Penetration**: Ensuring that users need to own certain hardware devices for MFA helps tech companies penetrate deeper into the market. Users who may not have previously seen the need to upgrade or purchase new devices are now incentivized to do so, driven by the security requirements of their online accounts.
2. **Monopolization and Vendor Lock-in**
   * **Product Ecosystem**: Large tech companies often create an ecosystem of products that work seamlessly together. By integrating MFA that requires specific devices, these companies lock users into their ecosystem. For instance, a user with a smartphone from a particular brand is more likely to purchase additional products from the same brand to maintain compatibility and convenience.
   * **Subscription and Service Fees**: Beyond hardware sales, tech companies benefit economically from ongoing service fees associated with device maintenance and software updates. Users might subscribe to premium services that offer enhanced security features, further adding to the revenue streams of these companies.
3. **Data Collection and User Profiling**
   * **Enhanced Data Analytics**: Requiring hardware for MFA allows tech companies to collect more data on user behavior and device usage. This data is invaluable for creating detailed user profiles, which can be used for targeted advertising and personalized marketing.
   * **Improved User Insights**: With access to more granular data about how and when devices are used, companies can gain deeper insights into user preferences and habits. This information helps in refining product offerings and tailoring services to meet user needs more effectively.
4. **Strengthened Market Position**
   * **Competitive Advantage**: By making their devices essential for accessing secure services, tech companies strengthen their market position against competitors. This requirement creates a barrier to entry for other companies and makes it harder for users to switch to competing products.
   * **Brand Loyalty**: Users who invest in the ecosystem of a tech company are less likely to switch to another provider due to the inconvenience and cost associated with changing devices and migrating data. This strategy fosters brand loyalty and increases customer retention.

MFA transforms security into a marketable product, where users must purchase specific devices to ensure their safety online. By tying MFA to expensive hardware, tech companies effectively monetize the basic need for digital security. This practice compels consumers to invest in the company's devices, reinforcing the consumer's financial dependence on the tech company.

Additionally, big tech companies create an artificial scarcity by promoting the narrative that advanced security is only achievable through their proprietary hardware. This perceived need drives consumers to purchase and upgrade their devices regularly, perpetuating a cycle of dependency and consumption.

### **Surveillance and Privacy Concerns: Ethical and Social Implications**

MFA systems, by requiring frequent authentication and data sharing, create a digital panopticon. Users are constantly monitored, and their data is collected and analyzed, normalizing surveillance and reducing privacy. This continuous observation exerts a subtle form of control over users' actions and choices.

MFA systems collect vast amounts of personal data, which can be used to refine advertising algorithms, enhance user profiling, and generate revenue through targeted marketing. This exploitation of personal data not only invades user privacy but also creates a revenue stream for the tech companies at the expense of user autonomy.

The mandatory use of MFA, which requires specific devices, limits consumer autonomy by coercing them into using particular products. This coercion undermines the consumer's freedom to choose alternative security measures or devices, effectively reducing their ability to act independently.

By mandating MFA that relies on expensive hardware, tech companies exacerbate digital inequality. Individuals who cannot afford these devices are left vulnerable to security threats or excluded from accessing secure services, deepening the divide between different socio-economic groups.

1. **Privacy Concerns**
   * **Surveillance Potential**: The extensive data collection enabled by hardware-dependent MFA raises privacy concerns. Users may be unaware of the extent to which their behavior and personal information are monitored and analyzed.
   * **Transparency and Consent**: Ethical questions arise regarding the transparency of data practices and whether users fully understand and consent to the data collection associated with their hardware devices.
2. **Equity and Access**
   * **Barrier to Entry**: The requirement for expensive hardware creates barriers to entry for users from lower socio-economic backgrounds, limiting their access to secure online services.
   * **Digital Exclusion**: This practice can lead to digital exclusion, where only those who can afford the necessary devices can benefit from enhanced security, leaving others vulnerable to cyber threats.

#### Assessment of MFA Flaws

The strategy behind big tech's push to mandate the use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for regular consumer authentication and credentials reveals a deliberate plan of control, dependency, and economic exploitation. By requiring specific hardware devices for MFA, tech companies reinforce consumer reliance on their ecosystems, monetizing digital security and normalizing surveillance. This practice not only undermines individual autonomy and exacerbates digital inequality but also creates a system where user data is continuously harvested and exploited.

The economic benefits for these companies are substantial. By binding security to hardware ownership, tech companies boost hardware sales, enhance data collection capabilities, and strengthen their market positions. They effectively create a dependency where users must continually engage with their products, fostering a captive user base and reinforcing brand loyalty. The strategy of promoting the necessity of proprietary hardware for advanced security further drives consumers to purchase and upgrade their devices regularly, perpetuating a cycle of dependency and consumption.

However, this approach raises significant ethical and social concerns. The mandatory use of expensive hardware for MFA limits consumer autonomy, as it coerces users into using particular products and undermines their freedom to choose alternative security measures. Additionally, this practice exacerbates digital inequality by excluding individuals who cannot afford the required devices from accessing secure online services, deepening socio-economic divides. The extensive data collection enabled by hardware-dependent MFA also poses privacy risks, as users may not fully understand or consent to the extent of data monitoring and analysis.

While hardware-dependent MFA  might offer the appearance of "**enhanced security**", in reality it  introduces significant ethical and equity concerns that must be addressed.
