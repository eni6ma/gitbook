# Fundamental of Security

### **Authentication, Verification, and Single Sign-On (SSO)** &#x20;

Authentication is the essential process of verifying a user, device, or entity's identity before allowing access to system resources, using credentials like passwords, biometric data, or digital certificates. This process ensures that only authorized entities access specific resources, forming the first line of defense against unauthorized entry. Verification complements authentication by confirming the integrity and authenticity of data, employing cryptographic methods like digital signatures and hashes. Single Sign-On (SSO) enhances this framework by allowing users to authenticate once and access multiple applications without repeated log-ins, significantly improving both security by minimizing credential exposure and user experience by simplifying access across platforms.

**Access Control, Authority, and Permissions** &#x20;

Access control mechanisms such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Mandatory Access Control (MAC) determine user access levels within a system based on established permissions. These control systems ensure users can only execute actions within their roles, reducing organizational risk and safeguarding sensitive information. Authority within these frameworks denotes the power to make decisions or control resources, essential for enforcing rights and permissions efficiently. This governance ensures that all system actions are authorized and auditable, maintaining operational integrity and compliance.

**Digital Identity and Sovereign Identity** &#x20;

Managing digital identities involves safeguarding personal identity information to prevent unauthorized access and identity theft. Sovereign identity extends this concept, enabling individuals to manage their identity across various services without central oversight, often utilizing blockchain technology for enhanced security and portability. These frameworks ensure that personal data is handled securely, respecting privacy and enhancing user control over their information.

**Voting, Certification, and Consensus Mechanisms** &#x20;

Digital voting leverages cryptography to secure votes, ensuring anonymity and resistance to tampering, while certification processes verify compliance with standards, issuing digital certificates that authenticate identities and secure communications. In distributed systems like blockchains, consensus algorithms such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) play a critical role in maintaining a consistent and secure ledger, preventing issues like double-spending by ensuring all nodes in the network agree on the validity of data.

**Irrefutable Evidence and Provenance** &#x20;

Irrefutable evidence and data provenance are critical in legal, financial, and security contexts, ensuring data integrity and authenticity. Provenance tracks the history of data from creation through various changes, providing a transparent and auditable trail that confirms data has not been altered inappropriately. This traceability is crucial for making informed decisions based on reliable and unaltered information.

## Authentication

There are CURRENTLY three types of authentication used in security procedures. They are something the authenticator knows or has in their possession in order to complete the authentication.

1. **KNOWLEDGE - Something that you know:** These include things like usernames, passwords, PIN, and answers to security questions.\

2. **POSSESSIVE -Something that you have:** These are physical items like badges with RFID chips, smart cards, or smartphones.\

3. **BIOPHYSICAL - Something that you are:** This covers biometric data, like fingerprints and voice or facial recognition.

In addition to the types of authentication, there is also different levels of authentication. These include normal, two-factor, and multi-factor authentication. In two-factor and multi-factor authentication, all authentication steps must occur in order to get access.

1. **Normal authentication:** This requires only one type of authentication. Using a PIN to unlock a smartphone is an example of normal authentication.
2. **Two-Factor Authentication:** This occurs when you use more than one type of authentication. A debit card with a smart chip that also require a PIN is a common usage of two-factor identification.
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication:** This uses multiple types of authentication, sometimes several times. A computer that requires a username, password, and facial recognition to unlock would be an example of multi-factor authentication.
4. **Adaptive authentication** is a way that two-factor or multi-factor authentication is configured and deployed. It adapts the type of authentication to the user’s situation.

Depending upon user history and the risk level of the activity, adaptive authentication changes the level as needed. It can change between normal, two-factor or even multi-factor authentication as the situation dictates.

## Secure By Design

The "Secure by Design" concept is a critical paradigm in cybersecurity, focusing on the integration of security features during the initial design phase of system and software development rather than retrofitting them afterward. This proactive approach is essential for creating systems that inherently mitigate security vulnerabilities, positioning security as a core component of the development process rather than an afterthought. Secure by Design principles encourage a comprehensive view of system architecture from the beginning, integrating security into design specifications, architectural decisions, and system requirements. By addressing security early in the development lifecycle, it is possible to identify and mitigate potential security risks more effectively and economically, thereby avoiding the costly and risky process of addressing security holes post-deployment.

Implementing Secure by Design involves adopting security frameworks and standards such as the OWASP Top Ten early in the design phase, engaging in threat modeling to identify and mitigate specific threats, and setting secure defaults to ensure robust initial configurations. This approach minimizes the attack surface by reducing potential vulnerabilities and integrating secure coding practices, least privilege principles, and regular security audits throughout the development lifecycle. Such practices not only strengthen the system's defense against attacks but also promote the use of trusted libraries and regular updates, reducing risks associated with third-party components. As digital threats evolve in complexity, the adoption of Secure by Design is becoming indispensable, requiring a shift in organizational culture to prioritize security at the forefront of technological innovation and system architecture, ensuring the resilience and trustworthiness of digital systems in an increasingly complex cyber landscape.

### Fundamental Requirement of Modern Secure Systems Architecture

The "Secure by Design" concept is a pivotal paradigm in cybersecurity, focusing on the integration of security features during the initial design phase of system and software development, rather than as an afterthought. This approach inherently mitigates the risk of security vulnerabilities by ensuring that security is a central component of the development process. By embedding security into the architecture from the outset—through design specifications, architecture decisions, and system requirements—potential security risks can be identified and mitigated more effectively and economically. This proactive stance not only enhances security but also avoids the costly and risky process of patching vulnerabilities after a system is operational, which can often lead to exploits.

Secure by Design is founded on the principle of minimizing the system's attack surface—the various points where an unauthorized user could attempt to extract or input data. This reduction is achieved through secure coding practices, the application of the least privilege principles, and the integration of security controls directly into system components. These measures are essential for reducing the likelihood of attacks and for fortifying the system's overall security posture.

In practice, Secure by Design encompasses several key strategies such as adopting security frameworks and standards like the OWASP Top Ten during the design phase. These frameworks provide a baseline for preventing common vulnerabilities. Additionally, threat modeling processes are employed to identify and address potential threats and vulnerabilities specific to the application, which are then mitigated during the design and development phases. Secure default settings are another crucial aspect, ensuring that systems are configured with the maximum level of security from the start, thus reducing the risk of misconfiguration and enhancing defense against potential attacks.

Furthermore, the importance of dependency management is emphasized, advocating for the use of trusted and regularly updated libraries and frameworks to mitigate risks associated with third-party components. Regular security audits and reviews throughout the development lifecycle are encouraged to ensure continuous improvement and adaptation of security measures. By integrating feedback mechanisms and iterative testing, developers can identify and rectify security issues at multiple stages of development, thereby reinforcing the system’s security posture.

Secure by Design is not just a methodology; it is a philosophy that aligns with the broader objectives of creating sustainable and robust system architecture. It necessitates a cultural shift in how organizations approach product and software development, placing security at the forefront of technological innovation and design. As digital threats continue to evolve in complexity and scale, the Secure by Design approach is indispensable for ensuring the trustworthiness and resilience of digital systems.

This philosophy seamlessly integrates with critical security components such as Authentication and Single Sign-On (SSO), which enhance the security of digital identities and access management within cyber systems. Authentication rigorously verifies the identity of users using various credentials, ensuring that access is strictly granted to authorized users. SSO improves operational efficiency by enabling users to authenticate once to access multiple applications. This not only reduces the risk of credential exposure but also streamlines the management of user credentials.

Moreover, verification and non-repudiation ensure the integrity and authenticity of data across digital platforms. Verification uses cryptographic techniques to confirm data remains unaltered, while non-repudiation prevents entities from denying their involvement in transactions. Access control systems like RBAC and MAC define and enforce permissible user interactions with resources, enhancing security. Finally, the principles of provenance, irrefutable evidence, and validation of ownership are pivotal in managing data integrity and ownership in digital and decentralized environments, confirming that digital systems operate within a framework of trust, security, and legal compliance, critical for the digital economy's robust functioning.\
