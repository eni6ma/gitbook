# Cryptographic Security Patterns

### Common System Patterns of Implementation

* Authentication Systems: Utilize password hashing, digital certificates, and biometric verification.
* Single Sign-On (SSO): Employs centralized authentication mechanisms to provide access across multiple systems.
* Role-Based and Mandatory Access Control: Enforce access permissions based on user roles and predefined policies.
* Digital Signatures and Cryptographic Hashing: Ensure data integrity and support non-repudiation in digital transactions.
* Blockchain Technology: Utilizes consensus algorithms like PoW and PoS to secure transactions and manage digital identities securely.

### Concept in Detail

**Authority**

Authority in systems and network security is essential for managing access rights and permissions within a network or system. Authority can be structured in two main ways: centralized, where a single entity or group has control over decisions and management; or decentralized, where control is distributed among multiple entities or nodes. In the context of cybersecurity, authority also includes entities like Certificate Authorities (CAs), which are trusted to validate identities and issue digital certificates. The authority ensures that only authorized users can access or perform actions within a system, as seen through processes such as role assignment, resource access requests, and comprehensive audit trails to monitor and review all access and actions.

**Provenance**

Provenance in information systems provides a transparent and traceable history of data, detailing its origins and the subsequent changes it has undergone. This concept is crucial in data science, digital archives, and particularly in blockchain environments where integrity and auditability are paramount. Provenance ensures that data has not been improperly altered, and it allows for the validation of data authenticity and integrity throughout its lifecycle. By maintaining detailed logs of data processing and modifications, provenance enables users and auditors to verify compliance with regulatory standards and make informed decisions based on reliable and unaltered information.

**Non-Repudiation**

Non-repudiation prevents individuals or entities from denying their actions, particularly important in legal, business, and security contexts. This concept is often implemented through cryptographic techniques such as digital signatures, which ensure that a party cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or a message they sent. The process involves creating a digital signature using a private key that can then be verified by anyone with the corresponding public key, thereby affirming the sender’s identity and their commitment to the contents of the message.

**Validation of Ownership**

Validation of ownership is critical in digital systems where assets such as digital tokens, software licenses, or online identities need clear and indisputable ownership confirmation. This process typically uses cryptographic methods to ensure that the entity claiming ownership possesses the appropriate credentials or cryptographic keys that unequivocally link them to the asset. Such validation is fundamental in preventing fraud and unauthorized access in areas like digital rights management and blockchain transactions.

**Verification of Ledger Log**

Verification of CRUD operations on an arbitrary ledger log is crucial in maintaining the integrity and consistency of distributed ledgers like blockchains. This process involves authenticating and authorizing transactions to ensure they comply with the system’s consensus rules and are correctly linked within the ledger. By ensuring that all CRUD operations are authenticated, authorized, and recorded accurately, the system maintains an immutable and continuous ledger that is crucial for the integrity of distributed systems.

**Irrefutable Evidence**

Irrefutable evidence pertains to securely capturing and storing data so that its authenticity cannot be questioned, making it an essential component in legal disputes, financial audits, and security incident investigations. This is typically achieved through cryptographic sealing and time-stamping, which locks the data at the time of capture, preventing subsequent alterations. By providing a mechanism to verify the data’s integrity at any point, irrefutable evidence ensures that records are preserved in their original state, supporting robust compliance and legal scrutiny.
